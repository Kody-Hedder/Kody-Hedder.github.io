### choropleth map making
<div align="justify">
<p>As a student project we were tasked to make a choropleth map using publicly available census data over an 18-year period.</p>

<p>I wanted to research changes in ethnic population of census area units every 4 years to see how the Auckland population varies over time.</p>

<p>My results showed that over a 17 year trend, not only did the ethic population chosen for this study increase, but also migrated away from less affluent areas towards the more affluent areas in the Auckland area.</p>

<p>I was able to present my findings with confidence which were rewarded with high marks for that project.</p>

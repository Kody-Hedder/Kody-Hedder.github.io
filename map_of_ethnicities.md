### choropleth map making

<div align="justify">
As a student project we were tasked to make a choropleth map using publicly available census data over an 18-year period.

I wanted to research changes in ethnic population of census area units every 4 years to see how the Auckland population varies over time.

My results showed that over a 17 year trend, not only did the ethic population chosen for this study increase, but also migrated away from less affluent areas towards the more affluent areas in the Auckland area

I was able to present my findings with confidence which were rewarded with high marks for that project.

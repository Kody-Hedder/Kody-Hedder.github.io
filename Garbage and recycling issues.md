### Garbage disposal and recycling issues based on the contemporary application of human paleoecology

Contemporary societies are running out of space to put their rubbish bringing up question on how rubbish will be removed in the future. 

Efficient disposal is not always completely compatible with other desirable social ends.

Another big issue is the disconnect between us and rubbish and therefore disconnected to the effects of our waste on the landscape

One way to change our garbage treatment is to change our garbage therefore we need to understand the formational processes of our landfills through archaeological methods.

Results of these tests found material thought to be readily biodegradable persist for a long time within landfills paper accounted for 41.2% and food 2.7%. up to 25 years after it was thrown away.

Archaeological applications can therefore inform policy makers on the effects human activities have on the landscape. Changing policies to focus back on the human-environment relationship will slowly start changing human behaviours to reduce drastic changes of the landscape.

Tailoring urban design strategies to mitigate further environment degradation due to human behaviour and encourage sustainable development.

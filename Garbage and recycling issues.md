### Garbage disposal and recycling issues based on the contemporary application of human paleoecology
<div align="justify">
Contemporary societies are running out of space to put their rubbish bringing up question on how rubbish will be removed in the future.


Another big issue is the disconnect between us and rubbish and therefore disconnected to the effects of our waste on the landscape leading to the general population to not be concerned to what is being placed within our landfills.

One way to change our garbage treatment is to change our garbage. How we do this is to understand the formational processes of our landfills through archaeological methods. This method can inform policy makers about human activity (behaviour) and investigate the rate in which biological processes break down the material.

Results of these tests found material thought to be readily biodegradable persist for a long time within landfills paper accounted for 41.2% and food 2.7%. up to 25 years after it was thrown away.

Archaeological applications can therefore inform policy makers on the effects human activities have on the landscape. Changing policies to focus back on the human-environment relationship will slowly start changing human behaviours to reduce drastic changes of the landscape.

Tailoring urban design strategies to mitigate further environment degradation due to human behaviour and encourage sustainable development.

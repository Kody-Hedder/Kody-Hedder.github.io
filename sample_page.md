### <p align="center">Visibility vs Defensibility Spatial analysis of pre-colonial Maori fortifications</p>

**Project description:** 
<p align="justify">Prehistoric Maori fortifications are a prevalent piece in many of New Zealand’s landscapes. Built usually in elevated areas, the sites maximise the natural defences of the topography. The function of pā has been predominately seen as defensive sites however their function is not truly understood (Davidson, 1984). Using GIS analyses, an investigation will be launched to contribute to the growing body of literature surrounding Maori pā and propose an alternative function. Results indicate that defence was of greater concern than needing to be seen within the landscape but some areas do indicate that visibility was of greater concern.</p> 

### 1. Background

<p align="justify">New Zealand holds an important key in understanding settlement and cultural development in the Pacific. As one of the last landmasses to be colonised in the world, initial populations started small. As time went on, populations grew, tribal divisions became more prominent which was marked by an increase in warfare. Social reactions to an increase in warfare gave rise to the development of fortifications known as pā. 
Despite the research that has been undertaken around the study of pā, their functionality is still debated (Davidson, 1984). As humans change their behaviours, so too does the way they interact with things in the landscape. Therefore, trying to understand the function of these earthworks through time is difficult.
However, what we know is that they were first built with a purpose, and it is that initial cognitive behaviour is what I am interested in as to understand the primary function of pā within the landscape.</p>


### 2. Method

<p align="justify">Using viewshed to generate a spatial representation of the extent pā can see within the landscape we assume that areas that the pā can see, can also be seen by individuals. Therefore, the greater visual representation that pā have within the landscape indicates that sites were made to be seen and by extension to be symbolised as a place to be revered.
Using the slope analysis tool was used as a proxy to indicate the defensibility of the site. This was done to provide a contrasting arguement that function is more geared towards defence.
The ratio that was used was to compare high visibility/low defensibility (symbolic) and high visibility/high defensibility (defence) to determine the primary function of pā.</p>

### 3. Results

<p align="justify">Results showed the functionality of New Zealand hill forts and how these structures took advantage of the natural defensibility of the landscape rather than being a symbol of status in the landscape.</p>

### 4. Limitations

<p align="justify">Limitations of this study are landscape modification, dating issues, impedance factors which were not taken into consideration for this study which could have provided more valuable information to this research.</p>
